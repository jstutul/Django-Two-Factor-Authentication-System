"# Django-Two-Factor-Authentication-System" 
Actually i build a powerful authenticated system for Django website so that fake user could not use our website easily. A user first register our system then he\she have to wait for admin verification .After Admin verification admin send a email verification link to the user .Then After confirming email user can login to his\her account in our website.
